The game contains 3 levels; level1, level2, and debugRoom(only in name and design, based off of old impactjs level with some tuneups)
Level 1 contains two layers of parallax. The parallax could have been done better if my artistic skills were decent enough
There is (as of writing) no splash screen or top down level successfully implemented
Level design was done primarily in a platformer type game. Becomes more challenging as you progress from level1 to level2
Game theme is slaying princesses and committing regicide to rescue the zombie.
Box2d and selfportrait were not successfully implmented
Main player designed based on the red mage of final fantasy and plays well
Can run, fall, jump, swim(altered animation of jumping and falling), fly(used the bounce boards to test), climb(extremely sped up swim animation)
No swing animation is used
Hearts can be attacked to gain additional lives
Enemy static = king, does not move, killable, goal to kill in game, bleeds green
Enemy dynamic = princesses(aka pretty zombies)
3 attack types. Bow and arrow, fire potions, and turn invisible and launch fireballs which cause burn damage over time to enemies
player starts with 3 lives, marked on the user interface and can obtain two more, one through upper path, and one in the debugRoom
player starts with 1000 health(done because it's easier to manage with collision), decreases and when hits zero, player dies
